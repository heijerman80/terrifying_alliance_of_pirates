With a quiet chuckle, Dexter pressed on with his solitary walk. The ship was enveloped in an eerie stillness until, out of nowhere, a deafening scream pierced the silence. Dexter jumped, his heart pounding, as he looked around for the source of the sound. To his astonishment, it was a parrot, a massive and brilliantly colored creature, red and blue feathers shimmering in the moonlight. The parrot landed on Dexter's shoulder, its sharp beak uncomfortably close to his ear.

Startled but curious, Dexter tentatively reached out to pet the parrot. To his amazement, the bird nuzzled against his hand and let out a series of squawks and chirps. Dexter, feeling a strange connection with the feathered intruder, decided to keep it as a pet and promptly named it "Parrot." The parrot seemed to take to its new name with gusto, flapping its wings and squawking with approval.

With his newfound companion perched on his shoulder, Dexter's attention was drawn to a distant, radiant light on the horizon. It beckoned to him, a mesmerizing glow in the otherwise dark and fog-shrouded night. An inexplicable curiosity seized him, and he knew he had to explore the source of the light.

Dexter decided to take a lifeboat, embarking on a solitary journey into the unknown. The fog hung heavy on the water, and eerie sounds filled the air. The oars creaked as he rowed towards the mysterious light, each stroke punctuated by the disconcerting feeling of being watched by unseen eyes.

The journey was fraught with tension, the fog refusing to yield its secrets. The sounds grew stranger, echoing whispers and ethereal chants, like the echoes of long-lost souls. Dexter couldn't shake the sensation that he was venturing into the realm of the supernatural. Despite the treacherous atmosphere, his curiosity burned like the very light he was pursuing, driving him further into the unknown.
